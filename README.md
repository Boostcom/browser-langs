## Installation

## What's inside?

[BCP47](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) defines standard for language codes that browser should use. Specification is quite wide but we will use most common setup which is used today:

```
<2 letter ISO 639>
// e.g. "no", "ca", "nl"
```

or

```
<2 letter ISO 639>-<ISO 3166-1>
// e.g. "es-mx", "ar-sa", "nl-be"
```
